							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>The Didache</em> or "Teaching" is an early Christian manual that is dated around the early-2nd century by most scholars. Though the author of this work is not known, it assumes apostolic authority and considers itself to be the "Teaching of the Twelve." It is widely considered as the first Book of Church Order, of sorts.

							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>Cur Deus Homo</em>, translated "Why God-Man?", refers to the question of the nature of Christ's incarnation. In this fictional philosophical dialog between Anselm and Boso, a monk in Normandy, this question is handled masterfully and is arguably the first complete exposition of the doctrine of substitutionary atonement.

						<p class="description">
							<em>"The death of all was consummated in the Lord's body; yet, because the Word was in it, death and corruption were in the same act utterly abolished."</em>
							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>On the Incarnation</em> is an early treatise written by Athanasius (4th AD), one of the most deft theological-philosophical thinkers in the early church. Though Athanasius exhibited such unusual genius, his writing style and arguments are surprisingly easy-to-read. This text is just as potent for Church dogmatics today, since the doctrine of Christ's incarnation has always been under attack. Though under the discerning light of this treatise, these controversies simply show themselves to be the age-old heresies which Athanasius grappled with.

Written with the Christological tenets of Anselm's Cur Deus Homo, this advantages of this essay is more basic speak, toned to meet the inquiries of those on the quest for the "Historical Jesus." Though Bavinck does paint an earthy portrait of Jesus, he demonstrates how this actually complements the divine nature of Christ.

							<em>"Scripture teaches us that God created man in His own image, and thus endowed him with a capacity to understand, and to respond to, this revelation, and engendered in him a natural urge to seek communion with God and to glorify Him."</em>
							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>Summary of Christian Doctrine</em> was written to provide a quick reference for Reformed theology… especially for those situations when a friend might ask difficult questions like, "How is it that you believe in three Gods, yet also say you believe in one God?" The format of Bekhof's work is arranged to cover all the topics in Christian doctrine, yet concise enough to only concern itself with the key theses in the Reformed system.

In it, Burton delves into each mood and tense and cogently elucidates details of the Greek verbs while providing helpful scripture references as examples. Burton describes this handbook:
							<span class="break"></span>
							"Its main purpose is to contribute to the interpretation of the New Testament by the exposition of the functions of the verb in New Testament Greek, so far as those function are expressed by the distinctions of mood and tense."

How little soever the success may correspond with our wish, our labour is not lost when to-day is better than yesterday, provided with true singleness of mind we keep our aim, and aspire to the goal, not speaking flattering things to ourselves, nor indulging our vices, but making it our constant endeavour to become better, until we attain to goodness itself."</em>

							<em>On the Christian Life</em> became popular as it became clear that many were curious about Calvin's theology regarding the Christian life. In this accessible booklet, Calvin begins first by speaking about the marks of a true Christian, namely a "special love for righteousness." He then moves on to Christian discipleship and meditation upon the future life. And lastly, Calvin speaks in pragmatic terms regarding the exercises of these truths. This enriching treatment of the Christian life is sure to encourage biblical and robust Christian piety.

							Jonathan Edwards (October 5, 1703 &mdash; March 22, 1758) was a preacher, theologian, and missionary to Native Americans. Widely acknowledged to be America's most important philosophical theologian and greatest intellectuals, Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first fires of revival in 1733-1735 at his church, First Church, in Northampton, Massachusetts.

						<h6 class="contributors">Jonathan Edwards</h6>
						<p class="description">
							<em>"You have offended him infinitely more than ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is nothing but his hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment ... And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom of God."</em>
							<span class="break"></span>
							Guest preaching at a church in Connecticut, Jonathan Edwards delivered this sermon titled, <em>Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</em>. Sinners is an iconic sermon which characterizes both the times and the climate in New England during the Great Awakening and provides a unique glimpse into the theology of American Puritanism during the mid-18th century. Edwards' sometimes called "fire and brimstone" style of preaching was a well-known approach and would even render some benefit today for churches struggling with entrenched attitudes of spiritual lethargy.

							<em>"There is no question but every spiritual believing Jew, when he brought his sacrifice to be offered, and, according to the Lord's command, laid his hands upon it whilst it was yet alive (Lev. 1:4), did, from his heart, acknowledge that he himself had deserved to die, but by the mercy of God he was saved, and his desert laid upon the beast; and as that beast was to die, and to be offered in sacrifice for him, so did he believe that the Messiah should come and die for him, upon whom he put his hands, that is, laid all his iniquities by the hand of faith."</em>
							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>The Marrow of Modern Divinity</em> was a scandal when it was first presented to the reading public in the mid-17th century. In this book, Edward Fisher wrote under the pseudonym "E.F." boldly proclaiming the Calvinistic doctrines of grace and the free offer of the gospel. Most accented of the themes is his treatment of unconditional election&mdash;over and against the throes of legalism and antinomianism of his day. Take up this book and find out just how liberating the doctrines of grace can be!

							<em>"Even grammarians and schoolboys on street corners know that nothing more is signified by verbs in the imperative mood than what ought to be done, and that what is done or can be done should be expressed by words in the indicative. How is it that you theologians are twice as stupid as schoolboys, in that as soon as you get hold of a single imperative verb you infer an indicative meaning, as though the moment a thing is commanded it is done, or can be done?"</em>
							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>The Bondage of the Will</em> is considered by many as Martin Luther's most important work. The title of this work was a response to Erasmus' letter titled, <em>Freedom of the Will</em>, where his argument was that God's commands implied moral ability. In what has been considered a brilliant response to this was Luther's proposition that God's commands actually implied inability! This was simply Luther's near and dear doctrine of total depravity but in a form that is direct in its address and persuasive in its candor.

There is much interlocking of the branches, but the two tendencies, Modernism and supernaturalism, or (otherwise designated) non-doctrinal religion and historic Christianity, spring from different roots. In particular, I tried to show that Christianity is not a 'life,'as distinguished from a doctrine, and not a life that has doctrine as its changing symbolic expression, but that--exactly the other way around--it is a life founded on a doctrine."</em>

							<em>"This renewing of us by the Holy Ghost, as it is called, is one great way of mortification: he causes us to grow, thrive, flourish and abound in those graces which are contrary, opposite, and destructive to all the fruits of the flesh, and to the quiet or thriving of indwelling sin."</em>
							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>The Mortification of Sin</em> is an incisive treatise on a topic much neglected in the church. Written in the 17th century by the English Puritan, John Owen, this work has been an unfailing aid for believers for several centuries as a corrective against the notion of "harmless sin." Owen refutes this completely with his famous quote: "Be killing sin, or it will be killing you." Though Owen's style can be dense, reading this treatise one senses his acute sensitivity for doctrine is precisely the remedy for true Christian living.

							John Charles Ryle (May 10, 1816 &mdash; June 10, 1900) was the first Anglican bishop of Liverpool. He was a writer, pastor and an evangelical preacher. Ryle was a strong supporter of the evangelical school and a critic of Ritualism. Ryle was described as having a commanding presence and vigorous in advocating his principles albeit with a warm disposition. He was also credited with having success in evangelizing the blue collar community. His second son, Herbert Edward Ryle, became Dean of Westminster.

							Charles Haddon (C.H.) Spurgeon (19 June 1834 – 31 January 1892) was a British Particular Baptist preacher. Spurgeon remains highly influential among Christians of different denominations, among whom he is known as the "Prince of Preachers." In his lifetime, Spurgeon preached to around 10,000,000 people, often up to 10 times each week at different places. Spurgeon was the pastor of the congregation of the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London for 38 years. Spurgeon produced powerful sermons of penetrating thought and precise exposition. His oratory skills held throngs of listeners spellbound in the Metropolitan Tabernacle and many Christians have discovered Spurgeon's messages to be among the best in Christian literature.

							<em>"Because Christ is all in all, and all revelation and redemption alike are summed up in Him, it would be inconceivable that either revelation or its accompanying signs should continue after the completion of that great revelation with its accrediting works."</em>

							<em>Counterfeit Miracles</em> is a vigorous argument against the existence of the supernatural spiritual gifts. Warfield updates his readers with recent scholarship on the topic and gradually engages with various traditions (Roman Catholic, Medieval, Irvingite Gifts) that purport to posses charismatic gifts.

							<em>"If, then, we wish to find our way among them it must not be by pitting them indiscriminately against one another, but by following them regularly up the series. Supernaturalism must first be validated as against Naturalism, then Evangelicalism as against Sacerdotalism, then Particularism as against Universalism; and thus we shall arrive at length at the conception of the plan of salvation which does full justice to its specific character. It is to this survey that attention will be addressed in the succeeding lectures."</em>
							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>The Plan of Salvation</em> is a compilation of five lectures delivered in 1914 by Benjamin B. Warfield at Princeton Theological Seminary. In these lectures, Warfield thoughtfully analyzes and interacts with various soteriologies and arrives at the conclusion that, "There are fundamentally only two doctrines of salvation: that salvation is from God, and that salvation is from ourselves." How he arrives at this conclusion though is through enriching and edifying argumentation which are sure to evince that truly: salvation is from God alone.

						<h6 class="contributors">B.B. Warfield</h6>
						<p class="description">
							A short essay written by B.B. Warfield where he addresses the distinguishing aspects of a seminary education and the virtues vital for a student of theology.<span class="break"></span>"A minister must be both learned and religious. It is not a matter of choosing between the two. He must study, but he must study as in the presence of God and not in a secular spirit. He must recognize the privilege of pursuing his studies in the environment where God and salvation from sin are the air he breathes. He must also take advantage of every opportunity for corporate worship, particularly while he trains in the Theological Seminary. Christ Himself leads in setting the example of the importance of participating in corporate expressions of the religious life of the community. Ministerial work without taking time to pray is a tragic mistake. The two must combine if the servant of God is to give a pure, clear, and strong message."

							<em>
								"To what, then, does one attribute the fact that from the beginning this concept of the covenant appears so much in the foreground of Reformed theology? There must be something in its starting-point by which it feels itself drawn to this idea. Let us now in succession take a look at (1) the covenant of works, (2) the covenant of redemption, and (3) the covenant of grace."
							</em>
							<span class="break"></span>
							<em>Doctrine of the Covenant</em> is a brief essay in which Geerhardus Vos details the historical development of covenant theology, and provides a positive case for the Reformed view. This essay provides an accessible, short order explanation of the covenants, giving readers a key biblical hermeneutic for understanding the breadth of biblical history, and its cohesion via the covenants.

								"Traced to its ultimate root heavenly-mindedness is the thirst of the soul after God, the living God. The patriarchs looked not for some city in general, but for a city whose builder and maker was God. It is characteristic of faith that it not merely desires the perfect but desires the perfect as a work and gift of God."
